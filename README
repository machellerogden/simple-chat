Simple Chat

A simple chat server example using node.js, express.js, socket.io and knockout.js.


Requirements

You must have node.js v0.8.7 installed in order to use this example as is (check your active version with `node -v`). I'm sure it works fine with older versions as well but this hasn't been tested. If you'd like to configure it to run with an older version of node you'll need to edit the package.json.


Installation

	git clone git://github.com/pixeldreamer/simple-chat.git
	

Usage

	cd simple-chat/
	npm start

...then in your browser...

	http://localhost:3000/chat

...or...

	http://your-web-server.com:3000/chat
